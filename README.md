# CDAN
Code for our paper _**Cyclic Residual Convolutional Neural Network based on Dual Attention Mechanism
(CDAN) for CT Image Super-Resolution**_.
We won the first place in [AIM 2020 efficient super-resolution challenge], the accepted workshop paper and code will be released soon.

The model files are uploaded! You can use the train.py to train our CDAN and use the [test code] to reproduce results in the 
**The pretrained models and test codes are uploaded, now you can run test.py to get results in the challenge.**
